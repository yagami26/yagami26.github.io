	<p>I recently bought two Marshall products, one is a Major IV headphone, the other one is their portable bluetooth speaker Embertron II   </p>
<p>I had experience with Marshall products like their amplifiers which I use with my electric guitar. They're actually a pretty big name when it comes to their guitar amps. I knew there headphones had arrived in the market around 2018 when I saw someone wearing it in street and I really liked the premium and simple design they had. I was unsure of the audio quality though. I had owned Bose QC 25 headphones before and they were pretty expensive so I knew what to expect out of a music quality of a headphone. I loved Bose for their music quality and ANC technology.  </p>
<p>This time I decided to give Marshall a try. I loved the Major IV headphones, they don't have any fancy features like ANC but they sound well, the mids are balanced, the lows not too bad and highs are sweet and sharp. The one thing I hated about my Bose was how easily the earpads can rip off and Marshall offered me the peace of mind to switch them anytime.  </p>
<p>The Embertron II is a nice equipment too. I use it to watch movies on iPad and in fact I like to sleep with some Piano music on, and last night I kept it on for entire night. It comes with a small form factor but packs a punch. I love it's lows.  </p>
<p>Overall, I am quite satisfied with both the products. The physical knob to control audio levels, and skip tracks is just so simple and efficient design.  </p>
<p>Here is a small video of my <em><strong>Embertron II</strong></em></p>
