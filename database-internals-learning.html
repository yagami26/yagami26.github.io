    <h1>Background</h1>
<p>I have always liked the idea of doing small pet projects and making something. Back when I was an undergrad, I always used to make small utilities and pet projects about almost anything I found interesting.  </p>
<p>It was as simple as automation to download files using a python script and wget. Crawling anime sites, downloading mangas, filtering out canon episodes, making a small search engine etc. It would not be wrong to say I used to get an adrenaline rush when I used to build stuff.  </p>
<p>Now, it has almost been 6 years since I graduated from university and I haven't built anything significant, maybe because I got lazy. For few days now, I seem to be getting back to my curious self. </p>
<h1>Let's build a toy database</h1>
<h2>Why ?</h2>
<p>I have multiple reasons to pick this as a new project let me explain why</p>
<ul>
<li>Databases are used almost everywhere. Think about it mobile apps, websites, desktop applications. At front end layer ? I'm not sure but a quick google search does show a few results. </li>
<li>Databases come in many flavours and each of which seems very interesting Relational, NoSQL, Time Series, Wide Column Stores, Graph, GIS databases</li>
<li>Most developers know a high level understanding of databases and maybe they can conclude to a reasonable level which database to use. However how many know how are transactions are handled, how is the consistency maintained in distributed setup. I have been using databases daily, why not get a deeper understanding of how they work. </li>
<li>To explore more hardcore engineering related roles. Frankly, I have been building CRUD API's and backend systems for almost 4 years now and it doesn't seem that challenging to me personally. Not saying it is easy by any means or that I am some pro. But I don't find it that interesting now a days. </li>
</ul>
<h2>How ?</h2>
<p>The plan is to spend a lot of time reading and watching course videos. There are already a few good resources available for eg you can check <strong>CMU Database Group</strong> on Youtube or read <strong>Database Internals by Alex Petrov</strong> </p>
<p>I hope you will see something concrete by the end of year. Best of luck to me. </p>
