	<p>Short Post - I tried Hyprland today and for some reason it provides an even better battery backup on my laptop. I knew configuring X11 is tricky as it's very old. It didn't even take me 30 mins to configure the same Qtile keybindings which I struggled for so long, audio and brightness for example. And the animations really are super smooth, and I don't need a separate window manager(Qtile) and compositor (picom).  </p>
<p>The next step is to rice my waybar configuration, and make some tweaks to leverage my OLED screen even more. At 42% battery currently I can already get around 5h of backup. So using dark colors should optimise the battery usage a little more. Yes, it's not an ARM machine and it can't compete with macbooks but still for a x86 architecture machine, that's an insane amount of backup  </p>
<p><em>Absolutely loving Hyprland, so far</em> </p>
