	<p>Having installed arch linux again, I am going back to vim style of editing the files. I use neovim specifically and recently I struggled with how to yank lines from your editor to a global clipboard. This is needed at times when you want to copy something from your editor like code for eg to a clipboard and paste it in browser.  </p>
<p>I didn't knew that anything which is yanked or deleted in vim is stored into a register. To see the current content of all the registers, run <code>:reg</code> in command mode. </p>
<p>How to copy  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First you have to go into visual mode in vim using <code>Shift + V</code> then you can select the lines you want to copy, if it is the entire thing to end of file then you can also press <code>G</code>.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the lines are selected the next step is to yank them into a system clipboard register. In case of system clipboard in linux the register is <code>+</code>. So to copy into clipboard we simply do it using <code>"+y</code> to yank the selected lines in visual mode</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am really curious about the functionalities of registers in vim now. After all it's called one of the most powerful editors with a high learning curve due to a reason. Haha</p>
