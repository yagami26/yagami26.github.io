	<p>I was taught guitar in an unconventional way. It's been a decade and now I look back and see the shortcomings of the way I was taught. I was never taught rhythm or music theory, instead the focus was to play songs by feeling it and only focus on the songs I enjoyed playing. Although it was enough to get started, I still struggle to read music theory or apply it in songs I play. </p>
<p>One example of it is learning 'Until I found you - Stephen Sanchez', the song uses a 6 beats in a bar style. I can of course play it without focussing on the rhythm and it doesn't sound bad either. But I will start focussing on learning rhythm the right way. Currently I'm struggling to maintain the count in my head, which is a little annoying. But hey, it's never easy to learn something new. </p>
<p>I will post the song cover on Youtube once I have learnt it properly. </p>
