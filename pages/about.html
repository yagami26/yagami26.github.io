    </header>
    

    <p>Hola visitors, Ich bin <em>Khirod</em>.  </p>
<p>I hail from the mysterious subcontinent of India. I am a software engineer by profession, musician at heart and an all-around certified socially awkward guy.  </p>
<p>This blog is meant to be my personal space and the posts I write here are not meant to be treated as regular blog posts by audience, as some posts are very short and sometimes the writing style is very unorthodox.   </p>
<p>I wanted to get back to writing on a regular basis, so this is the place where I experiment with various kinds of writing. Think of it as a scrapbox where I practically write about everything from my various hobbies (guitar, chess, software development). Of course, if you are my stalker or want to know more about what I'm working on a daily basis, feel free to browse through it, <em>haha</em>.  </p>
<p>Because this blog is written in a rather unconventional and simple style with lots of posts, you may find it useful to browse using the tags section. If you are indeed here because you're interested in tech, I hope you find something useful.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Thank you for sparing 2 mins to visit my blog</em></strong> </p>
