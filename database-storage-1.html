<p>Writing this post just for my reference and these serve as notes. You should check out the actual course videos by Andy. He is a wonderful instructor with a great sense of humour. These course notes are not as tenth as good as the actual lectures. This post basically revolves around how the data is stored in databases in a high level. Specifically we are talking about databases which store data on your disk. I can't guarantee the correctness of it with the lecture but is a log of what I understood from the lectures.</p>

<h1 id="disk-oriented-architecture">Disk Oriented Architecture</h1>
<p>The DBMS assumes that the primary storage location of the database is on a non-volatile disk. And that the DBMS components manage the movement of data between non-volatile (disk) and volatile storage (RAM/memory).</p>
<h2 id="volatile-vs-non-volatile-storage"><u>Volatile vs Non-Volatile Storage</u></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Writes and Reads to volatile storages are super fast while for non-volatile storages are slow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Volatile storages provide fast random access and sequential access. Eg - give me a byte stored at specific memory address. </li>
<li>Non-Volatile storage provide <u>fast sequential access on blocks</u>. We can read sequential blocks (A block is a set of physical sectors on hard drive, <a href="http://www.alphaurax-computer.com/computer-tips/hard-drive-knowledge-blocks-vs-sectors">read</a>) i.e reading sequential blocks is faster than reading random blocks. However it is still slower than volatile storage.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volatile Storage is super expensive, disks are cheaper.   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-optane-technology.html">Intel Optane is future</a></p>
<h2 id="goals-of-a-disk-oriented-dbms"><u>Goals of a disk oriented DBMS</u></h2>
<ul>
<li>Allow system to manage databases that exceed the amount of memory available (think virtual memory on OS but not <code>mmap</code>).<br>
  Interesting reading here is why not use OS mmap for DBMS. Many databases like mongoDB and SQLite use this. Refer to the original lecture. MongoDB later moved from mmap. Andy explains that database systems can do better by having context about data and making decisions by data manager rather than leaving it to OS.  </li>
<li>Reading / writing to a disk is expensive, so manage carefully to avoid performance degradation of read and write.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-level-diagram-of-disk-oriented-dbms"><u>High Level Diagram of Disk Oriented DBMS</u></h2>
<p><img alt="Pelican" src="../images/database/high-level-diagram-db-1.jpeg"></p>
<ol>
<li>Database Files - Database systems store data records in data and index files. For now think of it as a structure used to store data. <u>These database files store data in a fixed size logical unit called pages</u>. Each page may span multiple disk blocks. Database systems may use different kind of files (data files, index files) but we'll talk about that later.  </li>
<li>Buffer Pools - A buffer pool is a structure in main memory which is used by DBMS to store pages in main memory. Pages from database file can be swapped in and out here.  </li>
</ol>
<p>An execution engine / high level component of database system requests a page from buffer pool. If the page is present in buffer pool a pointer to page is returned, otherwise it asks a database file to find the page and swaps it into the pool.</p>
<h1 id="database-storage">Database Storage</h1>
<p>Basically we are building a storage manager. Remember not using mmap. A storage manager is responsible for </p>
<ul>
<li>Tracks data read / written to pages</li>
<li>Tracks the available space in pages or which pages are available for write.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-storage"><strong>File Storage</strong></h2>
<p>Most database systems store data as one or more files on disk. The OS doesn't know anything about these files. 
These files formats are proprietary. For eg - Postgres has a data directory. And these formats are non interchangable. So you can't use a database file for postgres and use it for SQLite.  </p>
<h3 id="database-pages"><u>Database Pages</u></h3>
<p>A page is a fixed size block of data</p>
<ul>
<li>It can contain tuples, meta-data, indexes.  </li>
<li>Most systems don't mix page types. </li>
<li>Some systems require page to be self contained i.e, the page should have all the information in itself to describe what kind of data it contains. This strategy is useful in cases where a physical disk failure of metadata page doesn't make the entire data unreadable.   </li>
</ul>
<p>Each page is given a unique identifier</p>
<ul>
<li>The DBMS uses an indirection layer to map page ids to physical locations on disk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical database page size is from 512B to 16KB  </p>
<h3 id="hardware-pages"><u>Hardware Pages</u></h3>
<p>Hardware page is different from a database page. Hardware Page is the smallest unit of the data for which the hardware can guarantee a <strong><u>failsafe write</u></strong>.   </p>
<p>To write a page of database on actual disk let's say which is 8 KB, the hardware can only ensure that it can write 4KB at once atomically, it is possible that writing the other 4KB may fail.   </p>
<p>A hardware page size is usually 4KB   </p>
<h2 id="database-heap-file"><strong>Database Heap File</strong></h2>
<p>A heap file or the database file which we referred in high level diagram of DBMS tells us how the pages are stored inside a file. We want to locate the free pages available on disk and to find a specific page with a page id. </p>
<h3 id="page-directory"><u>Page Directory</u></h3>
<p><img alt="Pelican" src="../images/database/page-directory.jpeg"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's a special page which tracks the location (block address) of data pages (tuple pages) in one or multiple database files. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The directory also records the number of free slots per page (we'll know more about slots when we see the page structure). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DBMS has to make sure that this page directory is in sync with data pages.  There could be problems for eg - you write a new data page, but while updating the directory the actual hardware page write failed. Wonder how they solve this ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="page-layout"><u>Page Layout</u></h3>
<h4 id="page-header">Page Header</h4>
<p>Every page contains a header of metadata about page's contents. Eg </p>
<ul>
<li>Page Size - The size of the page. Since page is actually a fixed size block, it may not necessary be full all the time. Depends on how tuples are stored.</li>
<li>Checksum - Used for database recovery. How ?</li>
<li>DBMS Version - which version of software wrote this page. </li>
<li>Transaction Visibility - which queries are allowed to see this page or update this page</li>
<li>Compression Information - compression technique used to compress this page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actual data inside page can be stored using two approaches</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuple Oriented</li>
<li>Log Structured </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="storing-tuples-fixed-length-tuples-vs-slotted-pages">Storing Tuples (Fixed Length Tuples vs Slotted Pages)</h4>
<p>What is the best strategy to store data tuples in a page ? We have let's say a page of 16 KB and header occupies 2KB, should we start inserting data directly from the 2KB offset ?  and store like the image shown below. </p>
<p><img alt="Pelican" src="../images/database/strawman-tuple-layout.jpeg"></p>
<p><strong>Fixed Tuple Length</strong> </p>
<p>Let's assume all tuples occupy the same length. When an insert happens we can store a tuple if there is free space on the page at end or on the slot where a tuple was deleted. Extra metadata or a free list is maintained at header which points to the first record which is deleted, and the first record then points to the second record which is deleted, kind of like a linked list. </p>
<p>Usually the number of insertions are more than number of deletions, so it is not desirable to move tuples to reclaim space created by deleted tuples. This works perfectly for most fixed length tuples.</p>
<p>If free list is empty the next slot to insert can be determined arithmatically -&gt; (tuple_length * i) for inserting ith tuple.</p>
<p><strong>Variable Tuple Length</strong></p>
<p>In practice the tuples are not of fixed length. Think of a varchar, which can take any number of bytes depending on the size of string. So most relational databases implement slotted pages. <u>Slots are an indirection layer</u>.</p>
<p><img alt="Pelican" src="../images/database/slotted-pages.jpeg"></p>
<ul>
<li>Slots are created from left to right. Each slot stores the start offset address where tuple is stored.</li>
<li>Tuples are populated from right to left. This strategy can be used to efficiently use variable length tuples.</li>
<li>Free space is always contiguous and always at the middle. </li>
<li>During a delete or length update of tuple slots are updated with correct offsets.</li>
<li>Page Header keeps track of number of used slots and the offset of starting localtion of the last slot used.</li>
<li>Tuples can be moved from one place to another without affecting the slot identifiers. As slots only store the start address of the tuple. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For further reading of how Postgres stores these slotted pages you can check the <a href="#https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/include/storage/bufpage.h">source</a> and the <a href="#https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-page-layout.html">documentation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Record Ids</strong></p>
<p>DBMS needs a way to keep track of individual tuples. This is done by keeping a record id for each tuple. </p>
<p>Most common way of denoting a record id - &gt; <strong>page_id + slot</strong></p>
<p>In Postgres each table has a <code>ctid</code> field which is used to identify the tuple on physical disk. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/ddl-system-columns.html">Read here</a></p>
<p>Do note that these record ids don't mean anything as during a <code>vaccum</code> the tuples can be moved around the slots may change. </p>
<h3 id="tuple-layout"><u>Tuple Layout</u></h3>
<p>A tuple is essentially a sequence of bytes. DBMS has to interpret those bytes into attribute types and values. <u>This is where database schema comes into picture</u></p>
<p>Consider a simple schema like this</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> <span class="k">create</span> <span class="k">table</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">a</span> <span class="nb">int</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="k">NULL</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">b</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="k">c</span> <span class="nb">character</span> <span class="nb">varying</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Typically the tuple data is stored in the same order. See the below image
<img alt="Pelican" src="../images/database/tuple-layout.jpeg"></p>
<ul>
<li>The header stores information visibility info (concurrency control)</li>
<li>Also it stores bit map for null values. For eg - column <code>b</code> is nullable so it will not be stored/written into tuple. </li>
</ul>

<p>Consider these notes as WIP as even I am not sure how correct I am. These articles will be updated further as I do a lot more reading and research.</p>
