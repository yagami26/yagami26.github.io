	<p>I decided to setup LSP in neovim for Golang development. I had known about LSP's for a while and I think it is a step in the right direction. With abundance of text editors, it is essential that we give users the opportunity to setup their development environment. I have never been a fan of IDE's. The only IDE I recommend is IntelliJIdea if you're doing Java development. I still feel most of the IDEs are super bloated and force the users to do things a certain way. I prefer having a fast and efficient development environment and I'm trying to create a development environment using vim. I agree you have similar capability in IDE's in form of plugins but somehow IDE's have always felt slow and use a lot of resources.  </p>
<p>LSP is basically a language server, your editor becomes a client and you can interact with your server to execute commands and do things like code-completion, code search, reference search etc. In vim, you can create keybindings to invoke specific LSP actions. I am currently using neovim with lazy kickstart plugin to manage packages. It already came with Mason installed and all I had to do was install <code>gopls</code> language server for golang. The LSP server already starts itself and attaches itself to current buffer if you're editing a go file.  </p>
<p>Currently I'm happy with the results and will tweak my environment more in some time. Here is a gif to see what I'm talking about completely managed from vim and <em>NO MOUSE</em>  <img alt="lsp-gif" src="http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/lsp-go.gif"></p>
