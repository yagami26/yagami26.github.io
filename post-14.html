	<p>I practiced for almost 1.5 hours last night on the suggested weekly plan for my level on dojo. I had to spend 20 mins solving problems from the book by Lazslo Polgar on Mate in 2's, then focus 30 mins on reading the endgames part 1 by Jeremy Silman.  </p>
<p>The endgames part 1 is meant for beginners, and I could say I could quickly skim through most of the pages as I'm already pretty familiar with Two Queen, Two Rooks, Queen King and Rook King endgames. So overall I think I will just finish part 1 today just to update progress on Dojo (there we have to keep a track of progress of how many pages you read and how much time you spent)  </p>
<p>The interesting part for me however was the M2 exercises, I found out I was frequently misannotating the square names, or writing invalid moves sometimes by a queen. When you're playing most of the time online, the online board doesn't allow you to make invalid moves. I wrote a move where queen on h2 could move to Qa8, if you know anything about chess this is an invalid move. I need to work on following things from these mistakes about visualisation</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowing square names, the color of the square, and probably the squares adjacent to it. </li>
<li>Knowing if a piece can reach from one square to other. For king it would be adjacent squares, for pawn a square or two above or en-passant or takes, same for other pieces. I think the trickiest would be a knight. </li>
</ol>
<p>I have always realised that visualisation is an important skill, and that I should start working on it. It's a little daunting to imagine all the 64 squares in your head. I would probably start including some time to practice vision exercises on chess.com, and also holding a position in head and seeing where I was wrong. </p>
<p>I like the training program, it's intensive but as long as I keep finding out what I need to work on I dont mind paying 10 dollars a month.</p>
