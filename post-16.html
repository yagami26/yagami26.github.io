	<p>Opposition is a concept I always knew, but never really appreciated the beauty of it. Basically a king gains opposition, when it forces other king to move and not occupy an important square. </p>
<p>Take a look at this study for eg <iframe id="12760339" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" style="width:100%;border:none;height:500px" src="https://www.chess.com/emboard?id=12760339"></iframe><script nonce="chesscom-diagram">window.addEventListener("message",e=&gt;{e['data']&amp;&amp;"12760339"===e['data']['id']&amp;&amp;document.getElementById(<code>${e['data']['id']}</code>)&amp;&amp;(document.getElementById(<code>${e['data']['id']}</code>).style.height=<code>${e['data']['frameHeight']+37}px</code>)});</script></p>
<p>Here is another study to appreciate the opposition concept. <iframe id="12760389" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" style="width:100%;border:none;height:500px;" src="https://www.chess.com/emboard?id=12760389"></iframe><script nonce="chesscom-diagram">window.addEventListener("message",e=&gt;{e['data']&amp;&amp;"12760389"===e['data']['id']&amp;&amp;document.getElementById(<code>${e['data']['id']}</code>)&amp;&amp;(document.getElementById(<code>${e['data']['id']}</code>).style.height=<code>${e['data']['frameHeight']+37}px</code>)});</script></p>
<p>As a general rule I think we should notice the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's bad for enemy king to step in front of our promoting pawn</li>
<li>It's bad for our king be forced to lose opposition, because losing opposition forces us to move away. </li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from that as far as chess update goes, I think I really enjoyed analyzing my game in classical chess. I believe classical chess is the way for me to improve and appreciate chess better. I have this tendency to make moves instinctively. Take this study of endgames for example, I spent some time today and drilled down the concept slightly better than I had yesterday.</p>
<p>It was also interesting to do a write up of my game analysis I played as a part of Dojo (my online chess club). I had some insights. Mostly I believe I need to calm the fuck down during games and do the hard work (calculation :P), then evaluate the position and calculate variations of other candidate moves. Visualization is an exercise I think will develop with my Polgar mate exercises. </p>
<p>I believe this study will definitely be easier for me to review later. Ciao!</p>
