	<p>I played a Dojo round robin <a href="https://lichess.org/bUUcduTfv8ez">classical game</a> just now, and although I have slept properly and woken up at the right time, ate properly, even exercised a little bit before the game. I was in good mood while playing the game, but I felt I lacked the desire to win. I lost the game in opening only, and I didn't care about losing. I think it's bad when you're trying to improve in a game. I do care about chess a bit, this is the reason why I'm writing this post now. I have been playing a lot of games recently and the result on chess.com or lichess is not good so far. Probably because I'm always paranoid that most of those guys are cheating. </p>
<p>I don't know what will back desire to win a game. Earlier the desire was to beat Arpit and that's why I improved very quickly, the goal of reaching 2000 is very shallow and I feel that I subconsciously believe that I'll never be able to reach that goal which is why I'm not playing games seriously. I do understand that playing 30+30 time control takes a lot of concentration, but I honestly believe that this format is the one which can make you improve. I think I have to improve my mental game. And I do believe that abstinence can help me improve at it. Just like anything related to dopamine, abstaining from it creates a desire for it. Here is what I am going to do</p>
<ul>
<li>No blitz, no rapid anywhere, only classical and only when it is with a bot or someone from a Dojo. </li>
<li>Most of the time should be spent on focussing on reading material. I am thoroughly enjoying some of the reading. </li>
<li>Include regular workout more often. </li>
<li>Get a consistent sleep schedule. </li>
</ul>
