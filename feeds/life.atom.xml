The last time I had alcohol was on 10th January 2025 with some colleagues. Alcohol has been my best friend and worst enemy at times. It helped me so much through my difficult times and sometimes it made my times difficult. It would not be wrong to say that I am (was) addicted to alcohol. I'm not sure if I have completely quit but it has been the longest time when I could actually abstain from it without any circumstances. Usually, when I was visiting my hometown or was with my parents, there was a good reason to not consume it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I am happy that I didn't take any for more than 30 days, and by the way I also completed 3 days without a smoke (another of my worst enemies)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="life"></category></entry></feed>
